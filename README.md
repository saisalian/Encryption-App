# AES Encryption and Decryption Web Application

This is a small project I developed during my undergraduate studies. I've uploaded it with some minor changes in libraries and technologies that are appropriate as per the current time. It demonstrates the basic concepts of encryption and decryption using the AES algorithm in a web application.

## Features:
- AES encryption and decryption of text.
- Simple, user-friendly interface to enter plaintext and view the encrypted text, and vice versa.
- Backend built with Flask (Python) to handle encryption logic.
- Frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide an interactive UI.

## Technologies Used:
- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Encryption**: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) via the `pycryptodome` library
